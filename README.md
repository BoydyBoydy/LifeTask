# LifeTask

## Purpose of this repository
Purpose:
- Issues-only repository
- Mirror for Application Download

If you have any issues with this application, please create a new issue for it.
These can be bugs or suggestions for improvement.

I'm happy to receive feedback either through GitHub or through the feedback form link in the application itself.

## Vision
Create a Personal Task Management Application that is suitable for most uses, that is free to use for individuals.
In addition to be able to track larger goals than just day to day.

This can include commercially for single person revenue-generating organisations.

(It is expected that if this software application is used for corporate or revenue generating companies (of 2 or more persons) that there would be a subscription amount to be paid)
