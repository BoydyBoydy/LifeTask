# LifeTask

## Purpose of this repository
This is an issues-only repository.

If you have any issues with this application, please create a new issue for it.

I'm happy to receive feedback either through GitHub or through the feedback form link in the application itself.

## Vision
Create a Personal Task Management Application that is suitable for most uses, that is free to use for individuals.

This can include single person organisations.

(It is expected that if this software application is used for corporate or revenue generating companies that there would be a subscription amount to be paid)

## Expected Features

- General Task Management
- Projects / Themes / Epics / User Stories / Tasks
- Releases - Group of work that needs to be completed
- Daily / Weekly Views
- Monthly View
- Story Maps
- OKRs / Goal Tracking
- Metrics

## How to use

As this is still newly being developed it is only supported on Windows, even though it might be able to work on other Operating Systems.

### Files created
This Application will create a new folder and filename under the path:

- Documents \ LifeTask \ LifeTask.txt

## License / End User License Agreement
