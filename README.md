# LifeTask

## Purpose of this repository
Purpose:
- Issues-only repository
- Mirror for Application Download

If you have any issues with this application, please create a new issue for it.
These can be bugs or suggestions for improvement.

I'm happy to receive feedback either through GitHub or through the feedback form link in the application itself.

## Vision
Create a Personal Task Management Application that is suitable for most uses, that is free to use for individuals.

This can include commercially for single person revenue-generating organisations.

(It is expected that if this software application is used for corporate or revenue generating companies (of 2 or more persons) that there would be a subscription amount to be paid)

## Expected Features

- General Task Management
- Projects / Themes / Epics / User Stories / Tasks - General Task Types to be used to link to other Task Types
- Releases - Group of work that needs to be completed, Sprints
- Daily / Weekly Views
- Monthly View
- Story Maps
- OKRs / Goal Tracking
- Metrics

## How to use

As this is still newly being developed it is only supported on Windows.
Other Operating Systems might be available later.

### Files created
This Application will create a new folder and filename under the path:

- Documents \ LifeTask
- with filenames such as : LifeTask-*.txt
